# shape-outside-line-box
Web component that will create a polygon shape around the enclosed text to allow text to wrap around it. This was inspired by some examples I created for some conference talks and web typography newsletter. Read more about there here:
- [We’re doing it wrong: there is no ‘one perfect design’ or layout](https://rwt.io/typography-tips/were-doing-it-wrong-there-no-one-perfect-design-or-layout)

- [Example on CodePen](https://codepen.io/jpamental/full/PoZEprx)

## Example
The `example.html` file contains a working example page to demonstrate the effect.

## The web component is working!
Really excited about this. Will document it more but it's working nicely with the defaults and example so far!
