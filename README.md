# shape-outside-line-box
Web component that will create a polygon shape around the enclosed text to allow text to wrap around it.

## Example
The `example.html` file contains a working example page to demonstrate the effect.

## The web component doesn't work
Hoping I can make some progress on that but for now just focused on making it worthwhile with basic JS
