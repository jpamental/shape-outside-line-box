# shape-outside-line-box
Web component that will create a polygon shape around the enclosed text to allow text to wrap around it.

## Example
The `example.html` file contains a working example page to demonstrate the effect.

## The web component is working!
Really excited about this. Will document it more but it's working nicely with the defaults and example so far!
